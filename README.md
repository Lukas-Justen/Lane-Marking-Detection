# Lane-Marking-Detection

This is the final project for the Geospatial Vision and Visualization class at Northwestern University. The goal of the project is detecting the lane marking for a small LIDAR point cloud. Therefore, we cannot use a Deep Learning algorithm that learns to identify the lane markings by looking at a vast amount of data. Instead we will need to build a system that is able to identify the marking just by looking at the intensity value within the point cloud.
